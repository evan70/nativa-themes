 * `public/dist/` is gitignored everywhere EXCEPT `dist/griffe/` (see the
 * freeze exception in .gitignore): a deploy without Node serves these bytes,
 * so their absence is a defect, not a build that has not run — nothing here
 * skips when the manifest is missing. Edit the bundle only by rebuilding
 * (`make assets`); a hand edit passes every assertion below except the
 * rebuild-identity the summary asks for, which is why phase 4.7 checks
 * `git status` after a rebuild instead of asserting it here.

     * griffe slider rules on every page.
